/*
 * red-black trees properties:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rbtree
 *
 *  1) A node is either red or black
 *  2) The root is black
 *  3) All leaves (NULL) are black
 *  4) Both children of every red node are black
 *  5) Every simple path from root to leaves contains the same number
 *     of black nodes.
 *
 *  4 and 5 give the O(log n) guarantee, since 4 implies you cannot have two
 *  consecutive red nodes in a path and every red node is therefore followed by
 *  a black. So if B is the number of black nodes on every simple path (as per
 *  5), then the longest possible path due to 4 is 2B.
 *
 *  We shall indicate color with case, where black nodes are uppercase and red
 *  nodes will be lowercase. Unknown color nodes shall be drawn as red within
 *  parentheses and have some accompanying text comment.

/*
 * Notes on lockless lookups:
 *
 * All stores to the tree structure (rb_left and rb_right) must be done using
 * WRITE_ONCE(). And we must not inadvertently cause (temporary) loops in the
 * tree structure as seen in program order.
 *
 * These two requirements will allow lockless iteration of the tree -- not
 * correct iteration mind you, tree rotations are not atomic so a lookup might
 * miss entire subtrees.
 *
 * But they do guarantee that any such traversal will only see valid elements
 * and that it will indeed complete -- does not get stuck in a loop.
 *
 * It also guarantees that if the lookup returns an element it is the 'correct'
 * one. But not returning an element does _NOT_ mean it's not present.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *
 * Stores to __rb_parent_color are not important for simple lookups so those
 * are left undone as of now. Nor did I check for loops involving parent
 * pointers.
